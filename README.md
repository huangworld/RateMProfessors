# RateMProfessors

This tool simplifies the process of looking up professors' RMP page on UM's LSA Course Guide at https://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/default.aspx.

Previously when students looks up an instructor on RMP for a course, their workflow will be the following (i.e. EECS482):
1) Go to https://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/default.aspx, enter course name;
2) On https://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=w_22_2370&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=EECS&catalog=482, they can find all the instructors
